## About Me: IT & Indian Gaming
I have spent over **6 years in the trenches of IT Operations**, specifically within the high-volume, highly regulated world of **Indian Gaming**.

After years of supporting infrastructure at **Remington Park** and **CT Technologies**, I know exactly how slot floors operate and where they are inefficient. I am now combining that operational grit with Python and ML to build tools that help casinos make smarter, data-driven decisions.

**My unique advantage?** I don't just know how to code models; I know where the data comes from, how slot machines communicate, and the operational constraints of the casino floor.

## Current Goal: Project Native Slots
I am currently pivoting my deep domain knowledge into **Machine Learning Engineering**.

My primary focus is developing a proprietary **ML Application for Native Slots**, a company where I serve as an Analyst/Owner.
* **The Problem:** Casino floors generate massive amounts of player and machine performance data that often goes underutilized.
* **The Solution:** I am building a predictive model to analyze slot performance trends and help casinos maximize their revenue.
* **The Goal:** To create a system that suggests optimal floor layouts and predictive maintenance schedules, maximizing revenue per square foot.
